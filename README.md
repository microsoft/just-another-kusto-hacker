In April 2025, the following challenge was presented:
- Write a Kusto query that outputs the string `"Just another Kusto hacker"`.
- The query can be as simple or as complex as authors like, as long as it is self-contained and can run on any Fabric EventHouse or Azure Data Explorer cluster.
- [Free Azure Data Explorer clusters](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/start-for-free-web-ui) or the [Azure Data Explorer Emulator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto-emulator-install) could be used for testing.

Participants were given the opportunity to vote on the most creative and innovative queries across multiple [categories](#categories).

[Sample queries](./resources/sample-queries) and [this blog post](https://y0nil.github.io/kusto.blog/blog-posts/jakh.html) were provided to help participants get inspired.

For full details of the contest, see [official rules](./CONTEST_RULES.md).

## Queries

<span style="color:#008080">***177 Kusto hackers submitted 202 queries! üöÄ***</span>

89 queries qualified to the voting stage - The participating queries can be found [here](./resources/participating-queries).

Queries that didn't meet the following criteria were excluded:

1. Had an invalid link to a GitHub gist.
2. Were semantically or syntactically invalid.
3. Were not self-contained, and relied on an external data source or a custom tool.
4. Did not output the requested string (`"Just another Kusto hacker"`) in any way, shape, or form.
5. Produced an inconsistent output when run sequentially.
6. Were too trivial. E.g.,:
  - `print "Just another Kusto hacker"`
  - `print base64_decode_tostring(base64_encode_tostring("Just another Kusto hacker"))`
  - `print strcat("Just another", "Kusto hacker")`

## Categories

Participating queries competed for votes in the following categories:

1. üé≠ **Most creative**: A query that showcases the most unique or unexpected approach to solving the problem in an obfuscated way. Creativity might involve innovative uses of query structures that are rarely used in typical queries.

2. ü§µ **Most elegant obfuscation**: A query that demonstrates elegance in its obfuscation, meaning that while the query is difficult to read, it does so in a sophisticated, intentional manner. Sometimes, simplicity (in terms of length or structure) can be elegant even if the query is complex to understand.

3. üòÜ **Best humor**: A query that makes people laugh while still being functional and obfuscated might win this category. This could include humorous variable names, messages embedded in the query, or absurd logic that results in unexpected, amusing behavior.

4. ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Best use of language features**: A query that utilizes unusual or advanced features of KQL to create the most obscure or unique result.

5. ü§è **Best minimalism**: A query that achieves maximum obfuscation with the least amount of code might win in this category.

6. üòç **People's choice**: The query that was liked the most. No special criteria, just the voters' personal preference.
